This repository includes modified assets from the game "Factorio"
by Wube Software Ltd., e.g. the graphics for the inserters
are just recolored versions of the normal items in the game.
Those assets are Copyright (C) by Wube Software Ltd. and therefore
their license/usage conditions apply to them. In short, they allow
pretty much any use within the "Free Mod for Factorio" sphere, but
not much else. For details, check their terms of service, which
at the time of writing this were available at
